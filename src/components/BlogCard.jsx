        To set up a React app using Vite, you first need to create a new Vite
        project. This can be done using the Vite CLI (Command Line Interface) or
        by manually setting up a Vite project. The Vite CLI provides a
        convenient way to scaffold a new project with predefined templates for
        different frameworks, including React.
